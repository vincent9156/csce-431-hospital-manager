= Instructions =

Mark whichever sections you are willing to work on. Remember that *we still need people to comment the code* so that our auto-generated documentation (found [http://dl.dropbox.com/u/417348/Docs/html/index.html here] for now) is complete by the time we turn everything in.

Once you have claimed a section, look it up in the [http://csce-431-hospital-manager.googlecode.com/files/Document%20Work-in-Progress.pdf work-in-progress document] to see which other subsections are involved. 

I added every file that was in the project at the time I created the document, but some have been removed since then, mostly from the appointments system. Feel free to remove subsections (such as classes, views, etc) if they are old and no longer included in the project.
